# Room_Occupancy_Project

#Overview
Selected Topic: Room occupancy detection for home or office using a variety of sensors such as temperature, motion, and humidity. Datasets from multiple experiments have been captured and provide on Kaggle and the UCI machine learning datasets site.
    Reasons for topic selection: The domain (people in a room) is something everyone can easily understand, the type of analysis needed (binary classification) is one of the skills we learned in this course, and availability of multiple, well formed datasets. Potential use cases for occupancy detection include:
        Room cleaning after occupancy such as in clinics, conference rooms, and other public settings; particularly
    Questions we hope to answer:
        Of the three datasets we selected, which one provides the best performance for accurate room occupancy detection?
            The answer to this also gives an indication of which sensor suite provides the best sensing capability
        What is the best occupancy detection performance that we can achieve given the available data using machine learning classification algorithms?
